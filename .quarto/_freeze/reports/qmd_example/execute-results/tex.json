All provinces have had a decline in horse populations since 1940. This is likely due to the rebound of the Canadian automotive industry after the Great Depression and the Second World War. An interesting follow-up visualisation would be car sales per year for each Province over the time period visualised above to further support this hypothesis.\n\nSuppose we were interested in looking in more closely at the province with the highest spread (in terms of standard deviation) of horse populations. We present the standard deviations in @table-horses-sd.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-horses-sd .cell tbl-cap='Standard deviation of historical (1906-1972) horse populations for each Canadian province.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\n|Province         |       Std|\n|:----------------|---------:|\n|Saskatchewan     | 377265.58|\n|Ontario          | 266435.32|\n|Alberta          | 266063.19|\n|Manitoba         | 122403.87|\n|Quebec           | 111411.10|\n|New Brunswick    |  22019.49|\n|Nova Scotia      |  19879.25|\n|British Columbia |  14945.66|\n|P.E.I.           |  11355.75|\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that we define standard deviation (of a sample) as\n\n$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^N (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{N-1} }$$\n\nAdditionally, note that in @table-horses-sd we consider the sample standard deviation of the number of horses during the same time span as @fig-horse-pops-plot.\n\n![Horse populations for the province with the largest standard deviation](../results/horse_pop_plot_largest_sd.png){#fig-horse-pop-plot-largest-sd width=60%}\n\nIn @fig-horse-pop-plot-largest-sd we zoom in and look at the province of Saskatchewan, which had the largest spread of values in terms of standard deviation.\n\n## References\n",
